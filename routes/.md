The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedia and, as of November 2020[update], has the most articles of any edition.[2] As of February 2021, 11% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3] As of 5 February 2021, there are 6,242,828 articles on the site,[4] having surpassed the 6 million mark on 23 January 2020.[5] In August 2020, the total volume of the compressed texts of the English Wikipedia's articles amounted to 18.6 gigabytes.[6]
The Simple English Wikipedia (simplewiki) is a variation in which most articles use only basic English vocabulary. There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon) Wikipedia (angwiki), and a test incubator version for the Middle English Wikipedia (enmwiki). Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[7]

Pioneering edition
See also: Wikipedia:Milestones
The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the largest. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",[8] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[9] navigation templates,[10] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[11] dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[12] and weekly collaborations.[13]
The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. These features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia and town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia.
Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text files, many of the images have been moved to Wikimedia Commons with the same name, as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use images and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not allowed on Commons.
Many of the most active participants in the Wikimedia Foundation, and the developers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, are English-speaking users.

Wikipedians
The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007,[14] just a little over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an account in late February 2006.[15]
Over 1,100,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.[16] Over 30,000 editors perform more than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.[17] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been performed on the English Wikipedia.[citation needed]
As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used language, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language is not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends to contain more information about general subjects. Often bringing in new perspectives, a strong motivation to contribute for them is to increase the coverage of topics outside the English world for an international audience and to enrich existing topics with missing information from non-English countries, thereby helping to reduce system
